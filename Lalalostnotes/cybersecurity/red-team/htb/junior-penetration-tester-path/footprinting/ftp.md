# FTP

The default port for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is 21. This port is used for standard, non-encrypted FTP connections. Explanation

* The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigned port 21 to FTP.&#x20;
* Port 21 is the "controlled port" and port 20 is the "data port".&#x20;
* FTP is often considered a "not secure" file transfer protocol because it sends data in clear text.&#x20;
* Some FTP servers support secure FTP (SFTP) using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which uses port 22 by default.&#x20;
